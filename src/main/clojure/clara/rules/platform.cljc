     "Groups the items of the given coll by f to each item.  Returns a seq of tuples of the form 
      [f-val xs] where xs are items from the coll and f-val is the result of applying f to any of 
      those xs.  Each x in xs has the same value (f x).  xs will be in the same order as they were
      found in coll.
      The behavior is similar to calling `(seq (group-by f coll))` However, the returned seq will
      always have consistent ordering from process to process.  The ordering is insertion order
      as new (f x) values are found traversing the given coll collection in its seq order.  The
      returned order is made consistent to ensure that relevant places within the rules engine that
      use this grouping logic have deterministic behavior across different processes."
